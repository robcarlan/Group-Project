$SPY $QQQ $IWM $VIX Things look pretty ugly.
$MSFT oh boy, don't buy just yet, let's see the reaction below 42
$NFLX Looking for $260 by Friday ;) the broader market movements don't support a jump regardless of ER beat
$BBRY all the hopeful sheeple lining up again for ER slaughterhouse. Never ceases to amaze-- wake up! This stock has done nothing-burger
$AMZN Going according as planned.
$TWTR big sell vol spike there. bring bulls whatcha got?
$TWTR - Pump and Dump ? Bad Earnings mean sp rise ? Come on, don't fool yourselves. Back to 40 in 2 weeks.
$AA sell sell sell
$TSLA they want to lead in automated cars? then who cares about performance? What a horrible idea
$AMZN sooo weak....but don't crash too fast...i am selling some 360 puts this week in order to free roll on my 360 puts for april....
$BBRY My rev estimate: $770m. Anything under $790 (flat q/q) will be bad for the stock. Over $800 will be good.
$GLD couple strength indications to aide in my Short thesis http://stks.co/f1vOR
$AA looking over the cliff: http://stks.co/s0mdm
$AAPL Why would you cut shipments unless you want to create an artificial shortage for a watch nobody wants, learning from $BBRY?
$GLD $GC_F breaking down again? Wow, what a shocker ;)
$AMZN the funny thing about t/a is that people always find a chart to fit their bias.
$SPY $DJIA $XIV $VIX Patience with Greece running low after tough week cnbc.com/id/102502607 Market will tank hard when this blows up !
$GOOG Google reminds me of $IBM. Old. Tired. Or like $ AMZN. The party is over. The glory days are gone.
$SPY this is so overbought, ready to break down
$AMZN Strongly overbought. See the STOCK INDICATORS section of this week's newsletter. oss.cc/Newsletters/oss_News...
$MSFT testing its $42.37 support level today as both the 1mo/6mo trends are bearish http://stks.co/a17ez
Expecting rotation out of momos heading into March. $AMZN $NFLX especially.
$VRNG if HJJ gets to rule he used 6.5% and may give laches based on Raging Bull ruling then GOOG will appeal to CAFC AGAIN
$HTZ $HPQ what the hell with this CNBC Ice cold water drop and the $MSFT CEO too. Looks stupid. Childish
$AMZN looks overpriced now.
$AAPL good short,clear pivot on 30min. Perma bulls hates short posts. :S Pivots looks 122.4/120.4
{video} Sell Shares $CRM Distribution day - Lagging benchmark $SPY - Not as expensive as $AMZN trades.thecontrariantrader....
$AAPL formed a descending triangle the past couple days, we can see a break below with these red days
Last week we discussed how $VIX is a mean reverting instrument, textbook case, now almost cut in 1/2, $VXX $50 calls sold at $4.75 now $0.70
$TSLA Lack of Demand for Tesla cars is my anxiety
adding some defense: $NFLX » 440 put » 13-Feb » 0.45
$AAPL -100 Dow.....one thing, war is coming IMHO
$AMZN 40% of sales are third party direct sales and AMZN takes commission of those. No direct buy from manufacturers. This is a great short
$SPY letting the STOCH get overbought for the 12:00 rug-pull
$GOOG Prediction for earnings, I think it will sell off regardless of #s tr8rs in a selling mood http://stks.co/s0tYm
$AAPL Afterhours joke....sucking in more longs...I don't trust to add until 115....still holding core and additional position started 125.xx

$AA zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-...
$TSLA Why would someone buy this if you could buy $GILD $APPL $MSFT $BABA $ATVI (just killed their q3 earnings and is about to pop)? The p/e
$AAPL Follow the chart. I called the 133 top...Were going downward right now. I'll tweet when its time to go bull.
I expect both USD ($UUP) and metals ($GLD $SLV) to pullback for the next month or two. Extremely bullish sentiments never end well.
$AAPL If this is how it acts on a green market day...get ready for a red one.
$GOOG There she goes below $500
$TWTR don't think for a min that this goes straight up...ain't gonna happen. If you've been in for a while you know what I mean.
$TSLA the company addresses a lot of issues but not every issue. Thinking that's because many assessments are true.
$TSLA - Everyone should sell before its too late just to be on the safe side. Can always jump back in when its safe.
$GPRO is a camera. If $GOOG wanted to build a youtube camera, $GPRO is finished.
$NFLX will be shorting this hard tomorrow
