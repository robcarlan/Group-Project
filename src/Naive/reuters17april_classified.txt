      "articleBody": "* Consolidated net profit up 8.5 pct to 63.81 bln rupees * Gross refining margin $10.1/barrel vs $9.3/barrel (Releads with shale, adds segment details) By Aman Shah MUMBAI, April 17 (Reuters) - Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd warned investors to expect slower growth from its U.S. shale assets in the near term as a slump in oil prices prompts spending cuts. However, the company posted better than expected fourth quarter profits on Friday, led by strong growth in margins at its core refining business. Reliance, also dogged by falling production at its domestic oil and gas business, said it would focus on cutting costs in its shale operations in light of a \"challenged\" market outlook. The prospect of another plunge in crude prices after two months of relative stability has prompted expectations that shale oil producers could go for another round of spending cuts. Reliance has invested $8.1 billion in three shale joint-ventures in the United States. Shale represents just a fraction of Reliance\u0027s overall profit, but is an important part of the firm\u0027s upstream business which has struggled at home. Investments to expand capacity at Reliance\u0027s core refining and petrochemicals businesses, however, helped the company post a 8.5 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 31. Its financial year runs to the end of March. The company\u0027s gross refining margin, or the profit it makes from each barrel of crude oil refined, hit an eight quarter high of $10.1 in the three months, compared with $9.3 in the same period a year earlier. The refining business at Reliance, which operates the world\u0027s largest refinery, accounted for over 70 percent of the company\u0027s gross turnover in the year ended March 2015, dwarfing its activities in telecoms, retail and upstream oil and gas. Excluding its non-energy businesses, Reliance reported an 11 percent rise in standalone quarterly net profit to 62.43 billion rupees, beating average analyst expectations of 58.74 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue from the company\u0027s retail business, which posted its first annual profit in the previous fiscal year after six years of losses, rose almost a third. The company, which has spent close to $12 billion in its yet-to-be-launched fourth generation telecoms ventures -- Reliance Jio, said it had made significant progress in building the physical network infrastructure towards the unit\u0027s rollout. It is widely expected to launch commercial services later this year. Shares of Reliance, the second-largest Indian company by market value, closed fractionally lower ahead of the results on Friday, while the benchmark index ended down 0.78 percent.

      "articleBody": "(Repeats April 16 item with no changes to text) * Canadian miner awarded $750 mln in arbitration decision * Dispute centers on Las Brisas gold concession * Major court decisions expected this year-Gold Reserve By Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, April 16 (Reuters) - Gold Reserve Inc, a small Canadian miner that lost its crown jewel in a 2009 expropriation, is targeting Venezuelan assets as it seeks to collect a $750 million arbitration award that would put new strains on the cash-strapped government\u0027s finances. With higher-profile cases including Exxon and ConocoPhillips mired in delays, a technicality in Gold Reserve\u0027s case filing has allowed it to aggressively seek out new jurisdictions to execute its award. Its actions could affect bondholders. Gold Reserve said on Monday it has served various Luxembourg banks with writs of garnishment relating to around $700 million in interest payments on Venezuelan bonds and funds. The company targeted banks seen as paying or transfer agents. The dispute puts more pressure on President Nicolas Maduro amid mounting worries about Venezuela\u0027s ability to service debt and stave off a potential technical default due to unpaid arbitration awards. \"We are definitely looking at other jurisdictions,\" Gold Reserve\u0027s president, Doug Belanger, told Reuters on Thursday. \"Anything that\u0027s a commercial asset of the Venezuelan government is on the table.\" He said Gold Reserve is eyeing countries with the \"best jurisdiction, best law and most assets.\" He declined to give further details. The company is also engaged in legal wrangling in France, Luxembourg and the United States, with decisions expected this year, Belanger said. Officials at Venezuela\u0027s petroleum and mining ministry were not immediately available to comment. ASSETS EYED As a major crude producer and exporter, socialist-run Venezuela has considerable international assets. And with 96 percent of its income stemming from oil revenue amid a deep recession, the stakes are high. The country owns major U.S refining unit Citgo Petroleum Corp and has stakes in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana, as well as a network of refineries in the Caribbean, Sweden and the United Kingdom. But Venezuela has also moved to sell some of these units, raising questions whether Caracas wants to reduce exposure to avoid potential asset grabs, although the government has said it would pay negative awards. Legal adversaries have blasted Venezuela\u0027s moves to recuse arbitrators or request revisions and annulments to awards as tactics designed to stave off paying. Gold Reserve took its case to an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) tribunal, which in September determined Venezuela must pay for the termination. The award is enforceable in any of the 150-plus member states party to the New York Convention. In parallel, Gold Reserve continues to talk with government representatives, Belanger said. \"There have been fruitful discussions recently,\" he said, declining to comment on whether any settlement offers were on the table. \"Venezuela has an opportunity to settle this.\" Venezuela in 2009 nationalized Gold Reserve\u0027s Las Brisas concession, one of Latin America\u0027s largest gold deposits, as part of a policy to increase state control of key economic sectors. Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Strategy at Jefferies, said it\u0027s unclear how much cash Venezuela has on hand to pay the award, which bears interest of Libor plus 2 percent. \"My initial thinking was that Venezuela will use delay tactics as long as possible but if there\u0027s a risk of a technical default they\u0027ll pay Gold Reserve,\" she said.

      "articleBody": "April 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world\u0027s No. 1 oilfield services provider, said it would cut a further 11,000 jobs and had reduced its capital spending plan for the year in anticipation of an extended lull in activity and slump in pricing. The company\u0027s first-quarter profit beat the average analyst estimate after it exercised strict cost controls. Schlumberger executives spoke to analysts on a conference call on Friday, a day after the company reported. Here is a selection of comments from Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard: \"The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly in North America, has been almost unprecedented and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar.\" \"In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we\u0027re seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers.\" \"Market pricing for certain products and services (in North America) has already reached unsustainable levels. However, we\u0027re being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contracts.\" \"In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms.\" \"Looking at the industry as a whole, the current financial challenges will not disappear, even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is therefore forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value.\" \"We expect the largest E\u0026P (exploration and production) investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30 percent. We further believe our recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells drilled and the refracturing market expand. We also anticipate our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels.\" \"In the international market, we expect 2015 E\u0026P spend to fall around 16 percent, which will create challenges in terms of activity and pricing levels, but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America.\" \"I\u0027d say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing and this is both shale liquids and shale gas.\" \"... The pricing concessions that are currently being given, we unfortunately are going to have to live with for a while, because it\u0027s going to be a pretty significant overcapacity for all sorts of services given the lower activity level ...\" (Reporting by Anet Josline Pinto and Swetha Gopinath in Bengaluru)",

China has allowed fund managers to lend stocks for short-selling, in order to increase the supply of shares. China H-Share index futures were down more than 4.24 percent at 1247 GMT. Global equities also lost ground on fears over the clampdown in China. \"There restrictions on short selling have been lifted in China and when one market sneezes, the rest of them usually react,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. U.S. data released Friday showed that the Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in February, pointing to signs of some inflation that should keep the Federal Reserve on course to start raising interest rates this year. The University of Michigan survey on consumer confidence is expected at 10:00 a.m. (1400 GMT). The U.S. quarterly earnings season has been mixed so far with companies beating lowered expectations, but some disappointing results Thursday after the markets closed and early on Friday have raised concerns. Shares of General Electric were down 0.6 percent at $27.46 after the company\u0027s revenue fell, hurt by the strong dollar. Results were also weighed by $16 billion in charges tied to its divestment of GE Capital assets. Honeywell International shares were up 0.3 percent at $104.11 in premarket trading after the manufacturer of aircraft climate control systems blamed a strong dollar for a 5 percent fall in revenue. American Express, the world\u0027s largest credit card issuer, reported quarterly revenue that fell short of analysts\u0027 estimates, hurt by a stronger dollar and the loss of several co-branded tie-ups. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices were down 12 percent at $2.53 before the bell after the chipmaker posted a bigger loss and said it expected weak demand for personal computers to continue for some time. \"Eventually people have to say, \"Ok, forget about the Fed and central bankers nonsense and focus on the fundamentals,\" because if the large-caps are coming in with lower-than-expected earnings, then you know that other smaller companies will be in trouble,\" said Saluzzi. Britain postponed a sale of Treasury bills and global bond trading was hit by a power outage Friday at business and market news provider Bloomberg, which competes with Thomson Reuters.

Our decision is to remain in Centerra and change its management. We do not trust the current management,\" Felix Kulov, the leader of the three-party majority in the Kyrgyz legislature, told journalists after the coalition\u0027s meeting. \"We support the government, we will not nationalise the venture,\" said coalition member Omurbek Tekebayev. Kyrgyzstan and the Toronto-listed miner have been in talks since 2013 on a deal that would involve the ex-Soviet nation swapping its 32.7 percent stake in Centerra for half of a joint venture that would control the Kumtor mine. But Kyrgyz Prime Minister Joomart Otorbayev said last week that forming such a venture was no longer in Kyrgyzstan\u0027s interest following a drop in the mine\u0027s reserves, recently published by Centerra Gold. He said Kyrgyzstan wanted to increase the number of its members on Centerra\u0027s board of directors. Kyrgyzstan currently has three representatives on the 11-member board, he said. The coalition plans to put to vote in parliament next week a draft resolution rejecting Kumtor\u0027s nationalisation, backed by the country\u0027s opposition, and propose to promote Kyrgyzstan\u0027s interests in Centerra Gold by \"introducing world-class managers\" in its board. No further details of the draft were available. Kumtor, located in a permafrost area in the Tien Shan mountains near the Chinese border, is Kyrgyzstan\u0027s largest gold field and Centerra Gold\u0027s core asset. In February Centerra published its 2014 year-end reserve and resource update, which put Kumtor\u0027s proven and probable reserves at an estimated 6.1 million ounces of contained gold, compared to 8.5 million as of end-2013.

      "articleBody": "* Long-term shareholders to get double voting rights in 2016 * Rebel resolution to keep simple voting rights falls short * Aims to build European media champion after divestments * Bollore cautions deal-making will take time, prudence (Adds result of vote, details) By Leila Abboud and Gwénaëlle Barzic PARIS, April 17 (Reuters) - Vivendi\u0027s chairman and main shareholder Vincent Bollore won double voting rights at the company\u0027s annual shareholders\u0027 meeting on Friday after opponents failed to get support for their motion to keep a one-share-one-vote structure. Bollore, a billionaire who made his name as a corporate raider, says giving him tighter control of Vivendi will enable him better to create a competitor to powerful, rich rivals like Google and Facebook. But the man who built transport and logistics company Bollore Groupe told shareholders at the meeting that it would take time to build Vivendi into a media powerhouse, warning that attractive deals in the industry were thin on the ground and the risk of overpaying considerable. Vivendi is in transition phase after selling off four of its six businesses and exiting telecoms completely. It has a 15 billion euro ($16.18 billion) war chest that it wants to deploy to become a European champion in media, building on its Universal Music Group and pay-TV business Canal Plus. Only 50.05 percent of shareholders voted in favour of the rebel resolution that would have kept the principle of one vote, one share. Under a law taking effect next year, a two-thirds majority is needed to stop the double voting rights switch. Bollore told the annual general meeting that double voting rights were \"in the interest of all holders\" not just himself, adding: \"Just look at Google or Facebook, where founders have a strong hold on groups and therefore can move very quickly.\" Once he has double voting rights, the tycoon will be able to decide almost single-handedly what happens next to Vivendi. Double voting rights already exist at many French companies and are set to become more widespread after France\u0027s Socialist government passed a law last year to grant them to shareholders registered for more than two years. The move came about because the state wants to keep its influence at companies like Renault and Orange while it sells off part of its stake in them to fund a reduction in the national debt. Eleven blue chips are trying to override the double voting rights law, and Vivendi was the only non-state backed one where the management did not propose and support a resolution to override the law. Bollore also told shareholders that Vivendi had to be realistic about its acquisition ambitions since sellers would not let go of media assets at cut-rate prices. \"None of the owners of media assets are going to sell us great businesses for less than their market value. So it\u0027s up to us to pay the right, fair price, then create value,\" Bollore said. Vivendi has been scouting for media targets in the past year and had pitches from bankers about various options including a mega deal to takeover European pay-TV leader Sky PLC and smaller moves to expand in radio, magazines and publishing. Earlier this month, Bollore made its first acquisition by buying video-sharing site Dailymotion for 217 million euros from French telecom group Orange, which had been looking for a buyer for years only to see the government scupper its sale to U.S. and Chinese buyers. Dailymotion has struggled to compete with much larger rival YouTube, which is owned by Google, attracting 128 million unique visitors per month versus 1 billion for YouTube. It has less than 100 million euros in sales compared to nearly $4 billion for YouTube. \"On acquisitions we will not be satisfied with only Dailymotion this year,\" Bollore told the audience, adding that Vivendi\u0027s strategy committee would meet on May 12 to discuss acquisition opportunities. Exane BNP Paribas analysts said Bollore\u0027s comments confirmed that \"big deals are unlikely and that value creation will take time\". Bruno Hareng, analyst at Oddo Securities, said the lack of clarity over Vivendi\u0027s acquisition plans could weigh on the shares in the coming months. Nevertheless Bollore\u0027s track record at creating value at companies from advertising agency Havas to industrial parts maker Vallourec should comfort investors \"We think the acquisitions will be modest in size (from 1 to 4 billion euros) and subject to strict financial criteria, just as Bollore has done at Havas,\" Hareng said. Vivendi shares were down 1.3 percent at 12:38 GMT, compared with a 1.5 percent drop for the French blue-chip index. ($1 \u003d 0.9270 euros) (Editing by Andrew Callus and Sophie Walker)",

      "articleBody": "* RR says deal is biggest in its history * First time Emirates orders RR engines for superjumbo fleet * Deal includes long-term package for service and maintenance * RR says 2,600 planned cuts will still go ahead (Adds management comments) By Sarah Young LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce has won a $9.2 billion deal to supply engines for 50 A380 aircraft for Dubai\u0027s Emirates airline, the largest order in its history and giving it a boost after a torrid year of profit warnings. Shares in the British company rose an initial 2 percent after Friday\u0027s announcement, which Rolls-Royce said was the biggest order placed with a British company outside the defence sector. It is the first time the Gulf carrier has ordered Rolls-Royce engines for its superjumbo fleet, the rest of which is powered by Engine Alliance, a joint venture of General Electric and Pratt \u0026 Whitney. Announcing the deal at a press conference attended by Rolls-Royce Chief Executive John Rishton and Emirates President Tim Clark, the companies said the aircraft in question would enter service from 2016. Though a shift in engine supplier is rare, the deal had been flagged by Clark in March, when he said he was considering Rolls-Royce engines for the aircraft. The selection could raise hopes that Rolls will win more orders from Emirates. Emirates, the leading buyer of the A380 jet with 140 orders, has said that if Airbus goes ahead with a revamp of its A380 superjumbo it would place a big order for that model. Clark has said he expected any so-called A380neo to be powered by Rolls-Royce engines based on its Trent XWB engine. \"As far as the neo is concerned, we await the deliberations from Toulouse,\" Clark told reporters on Friday, referring to Airbus headquarters. Rolls-Royce was also awaiting Airbus\u0027s decision on the A380 upgrade, the CEO said. \"We have said that if they do, we will support that. We think that we can find a business case for it.\" The contract signed on Friday for the classic A380 includes a long-term \"Totalcare\" package, which means Rolls-Royce will also provide service and maintenance to Emirates. Rolls-Royce is the world\u0027s second-largest maker of aeroengines after GE, but its outlook has been hit by cancelled orders in other parts of its business, where it makes power systems for the oil and gas, marine and industrial sectors. It warned in February that profits this year could fall by as much as 13 percent, on top of an 8 percent drop last year, saying the low oil price had increased uncertainty. In its aerospace division, the company is in the throes of a cost-cutting programme, aiming to shed 2,600 jobs to try to improve profitability. Rishton said the new order would help secure jobs but the 2,600 planned cuts would still go ahead. (Editing by Li-mei Hoang and David Holmes)",

Fabrice Bregier, chief executive of Airbus Group\u0027s passenger jet division, predicted that Airbus would recapture the global crown from Boeing as deliveries of its new A350 model pick up - while adding that market share was secondary to profitable growth. Airbus expects to deliver 15 of the wide-body A350 planes this year, Bregier told a group of journalists in Paris. He reiterated that Airbus would not abandon the A380 after a period of weak orders, but would take a careful look at the business case for the \u0027A380neo\u0027 upgrade requested by the model\u0027s biggest airline customer, Emirates. Bregier said the weak euro would have little short-term impact on Airbus due to hedging, but that it would provide immediate benefits to smaller parts suppliers. Airbus continues to expect more orders than deliveries in 2015, he also told members of the French AJPAE aerospace press association. (Reporting by Tim Hepher)",

However she said no date had yet been fixed for the next meeting at political, or ministerial, level.

The company also cut its full-year revenue forecast to $39 billion-$39.6 billion from $40.5 billion-$41.1 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $40.52 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell gets more than half its revenue from international operations and exports. The dollar rose 9 percent against a basket of currencies in the first three months of the year. The company sold its friction materials business, which makes auto parts such as drum brake linings, hydraulic components and brake fluid, to Federal Mogul for about $155 million last year. Honeywell\u0027s transportation unit, which included the friction materials business, accounted for about 10 percent of total revenue in 2013. Sales in the company\u0027s aerospace business - its largest - fell 6 percent to $3.61 billion in the first quarter, while sales at its automation and controls business fell 3 percent. Excluding the impact of the dollar and the sale of the friction materials business, sales in the aerospace business rose 1 percent. Revenue for the first quarter fell to $9.21 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $9.48 billion. Net income attributable to Honeywell rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.41 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.02 billion, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier. Total expenses fell 7.5 percent, while margins improved to 18.7 percent from 16.5 percent due to new product launches and cost cuts, the company said. Honeywell also raised the lower end of its full-year profit forecast to $6.00-$6.15 per share from $5.95-$6.15. Up to Thursday\u0027s close of $103.92, the company\u0027s shares had risen 4 percent this year. The stock was down marginally in light premarket trading. (Reporting by Rohit T.

      "articleBody": "* Global equities turn negative * Traders cite China clampdown fears, Bloomberg outage * U.S. rate hike appears further away after data run * German 10-year yields hit new all-time low * Weaker dollar helps emerging mkt shares (Adds China, Bloomberg, eurozone data) By Lionel Laurent LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Global equities lost ground on Friday as traders grappled with an outage of Bloomberg financial terminals and fears of a regulatory clampdown on trading in China. Worries that Greece may run out of money as debt repayments loom also spread through credit markets, with peripheral eurozone government debt rising while core German bund yields hit a new record low. Top European shares were down more than 1 percent, U.S. equity futures fell 0.7 percent and China H-Share index futures were down more than 5 percent at 1107 GMT, with traders saying the market sell-off was worsened by the expiry of futures and options on European indexes. Traders said markets were spooked by reports of a crackdown in China on over-the-counter margin trading and regulatory allowances for fund managers to lend shares for short-selling, saying this would be negative for the flow of recent money that has poured into Chinese exchanges. \"The securities regulator is encouraging short-selling to institutional investors, and they are going to stop margin trading on OTC,\" Ioan Smith, managing director of KCG Europe, said. \"Traders had to catch up with that news after the Bloomberg terminals came back online, and that\u0027s when we saw the falls in Europe.\" However, the MSCI All-Countries index is still set for a 0.4 percent gain for the week, on track for its third consecutive weekly gain, as cheap central bank cash buoys markets. A U.S. interest rate hike in the near term is now seen as less likely after a recent run of lackluster U.S. economic data that sent the dollar down for a fourth straight day on Friday to near a one-week low. At the same time, lingering worries about upcoming corporate earnings reports in the United States have been offset by corporate share buybacks, according to analysts and investors. \"The equity market does appear to have looked through the weakness in economic data and earnings with extraordinary aplomb,\" said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, in a note to clients. \"(U.S.) share buybacks have become a much more important driver for stock prices in the short-run as earnings-per-share growth wanes.\" General Electric posted a first-quarter net loss of $13.6 billion, weighed down by about $16 billion in charges tied to its exit of GE Capital assets. Excluding special items, GE posted earnings of 31 cents per share, topping by 1 cent the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. U.S. consumer inflation data is also due, and may reinforce the view that a near-term rise in rates is less likely. German 10-year yields hit a new all-time low of 0.05 percent, creeping closer to zero, as Greece sounded a mix of defiance and willingness to compromise with its international creditors on reforms required to unlock more loans. Spanish, Italian and Portuguese yields rose. Emerging market stocks hit a new seven-month high and headed for their third consecutive weekly gain, helped by expectations that a U.S. rate hike was further away than once thought. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart, a voting member of the Fed\u0027s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent \"murky\" run of U.S. data has him leaning against a June interest rate hike. Lockhart quickly added he was confident the economy would remain on track. Comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren also struck dovish tones. The rate-rise uncertainty left gold prices facing their second straight weekly drop, while London tin capitulated to more than five-year lows as growing supply from Myanmar and torpid demand punished prices. Brent crude oil prices fell on Friday, ending a run of rallies earlier in the week, after OPEC said that its output surged in March, adding to a global glut.

Revenue fell 1 percent in its industrial segments, hurt by a $950 million hit from the stronger dollar, GE said on Friday. Stripping out the currency drag and the impact from deals, sales rose 3 percent. The stronger dollar is expected to weigh on U.S. industrial companies, whose revenues are hurt when foreign sales are translated back into the U.S. currency. Overall, GE posted a first-quarter net loss of $13.6 billion, or $1.35 per share. Results were weighed down by about $16 billion in charges tied to its exit of GE Capital assets. The company disclosed last week it was shedding much of its finance business. Excluding special items, GE posted earnings of 31 cents per share, topping by 1 cent the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares slipped 0.7 percent to $27.09 in premarket trading. Sales in GE\u0027s oil and gas business, which has been in focus due to the slide in oil prices, dropped 8 percent, with profit down 3 percent. Excluding currency effects and the impact from deals, GE said its oil revenue was flat while operating profit rose 11 percent. GE had warned that sales and profits in its oil and gas segment could drop by 5 percent this year. But analysts have said the declines could be much steeper. \"On the oil and gas side, the revenues hung in there,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management. But he cautioned, \"The weakness in that business might still be ahead of it.\" Total sales fell 12.5 percent to $29.34 billion, as GE Capital revenue slid 39 percent. GE\u0027s industrial operating margins rose 1.2 percentage points to 14.6 percent from a year earlier, helped by administrative cost cuts and a greater mix of sales from higher-margin services. Orders slipped 3 percent, although they were up slightly, excluding currency effects. GE\u0027s shares soared the most in six years last Friday on the company\u0027s surprise announcement about GE Capital, pleasing investors who said the finance business weighed on GE\u0027s value as an industrial company.

      "articleBody": "(Repeats story with no change to text) By Malathi Nayak NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is rolling out a new pay TV plan that allows consumers to choose every month bundles of channels they want to see, hoping the flexibility will lure customers away from cable rivals and upstart Web TV companies. The move is a small step in the direction of \u0027a la carte\u0027 programming, which means allowing customers to build their own pay TV service, channel by channel. U.S. television networks have long resisted \u0027a la carte,\u0027 in part because of concerns that subscribers will drop less popular channels. Verizon said its new \"Custom TV\" packages start at $65 a month for broadband service, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, such as a sports bundle or kids channels. Users can add extra packs for $10 each, or swap or unsubscribe any pack after 30 days. Verizon has seven channel packs in total. Verizon is targeting consumers looking for something in between fully loaded cable and satellite TV packages, and \"skinny\" or smaller, cheaper bundles offered Comcast Corp or Dish Network Corp\u0027s online Sling TV. \"Everybody is getting into the video space... increasingly customers are saying, \u0027I want to pay for what I view,\u0027\" Tami Erwin, the president of Verizon\u0027s national operations told Reuters. Verizon\u0027s FiOS is the sixth-largest U.S. pay TV provider by video subscribers, according to research form IDC. The rise of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate. Analysts said Custom TV could help Verizon better compete against cable rivals. \"It\u0027s not a pure \u0027a la carte\u0027 the way some consumers want, but we are certainly through the Verizon offering going to have more choice and the type of choice that has not been associated with traditional pay TV services,\" Greg Ireland, a director at market research firm IDC said. Dish\u0027s Sling TV offers a fixed set of basic channels at $20 a month, and genre-specific bundles can be added for $5. The service runs on an Internet connection that a user needs to pay for separately. Chris Young, an analyst at research firm SNL Kagan, said Verizon is trying to give customers more customization and the greater amount of flexibility \"could prevent some customers from cutting the cord.\" (Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Tiffany Wu)",

      "articleBody": "(Repeats story from April 16 with no change to text) By David Morgan WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - Chinese drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd has established a strong early lead in the U.S. commercial market as companies turn to its inexpensive, light-weight flying devices for a host of uses from shooting films to mapping and site inspections. Sixty-one of the 129 companies that received regulatory approval to use unmanned aircraft are using DJI drones, or 47 percent, far ahead of its nearest rival, a Reuters review of federal records as of April 9 shows. Nearly 400 other companies, more than half of the 695 businesses still awaiting approval, have applied to use DJI drones. Shenzhen-based DJI, whose best-selling Phantom 2 Vision+ drone retails for around $1,200 in the United States, estimates that it already has about 70 percent of the commercial market worldwide and a larger portion of the consumer market. Federal records also suggest that DJI is quickly expanding its U.S. market share, thanks in part to a new process speeding federal exemptions for companies that intend to use drones previously vetted by regulators. DJI accounted for about a third of the roughly 50 exemptions granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from last September through mid-March. But it has claimed just over half of the 89 exemptions received since then. Industry experts say basic drones such as DJI\u0027s are likely to drive the U.S. commercial market for the foreseeable future, meeting business demand for uses such as aerial photography for site inspections, real estate promotions and video production. The market for more sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being limited by FAA policy that restricts commercial drone flights to line-of-sight operations at altitudes of 500 feet (152 meters) or less. Those rules are complicating efforts by e-commerce giants Amazon.com and Google Inc to develop high-tech drones capable of delivering packages over long distances. \"Those limitations effectively rule out larger UAVs, which are not going to be cost-effective with that sort of restriction,\" said Philip Finnegan, the Teal Group\u0027s director of corporate analysis. \"It\u0027s really going to drive things toward the low end of the market.\" The Teal Group expects the U.S. market for commercial drones to reach $5.4 billion in sales by 2023. Founded in 2006 by Chinese entrepreneur Frank Wang, DJI generated nearly $500 million in revenue in 2014, up from $130 million in the prior year. It expects to exceed $1 billion in sales this year and is in talks with investors to raise new capital. A person familiar with the discussions said DJI, valued at $10 billion, is also pursuing partnerships. EASE OF USE The emergence of a Chinese company as a dominant player in a new U.S. technology market has so far not raised concerns in Congress. Other Chinese technology companies including telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. have been accused by U.S. lawmakers of posing national security risks, hurting their chances of building a substantial U.S. business. DJI\u0027s U.S. business customers include American International Group Inc, Commonwealth Edison Co in addition to a host of lesser known firms in real estate, insurance, energy, agriculture and film and television. Due to safety concerns, U.S. companies are banned from using drones unless they obtain an FAA exemption. The U.S. aviation regulator proposed rules in February to lift the ban, but final regulations are not expected until late 2016 or early 2017. Since FAA began granting exemptions last September, gains have been limited for DJI\u0027s rivals, whose products are often much more expensive. DJI\u0027s nearest competitor in the U.S. commercial market is Swiss drone-maker senseFly, owned by Paris-based Parrot, with 8.5 percent of the exempted companies, federal records show. Sensefly\u0027s eBee mapping drone package has a price tag of around $25,000. More complex systems made by European and U.S. competitors can cost upwards of $100,000. DJI has gained its market lead without a U.S.-based sales staff. Both hobbyists and business customers purchase drones through online retail outlets and directly from DJI\u0027s site, and say they stand out for their ease of use as well as the low price. \"Everything just works. A lot of other systems require you to tweak all the settings and parameters,\" said Paul Callahan, chief executive of New York-based SouthGate Films, which won FAA approval this month to use a DJI drone for aerial photography including solar panel inspections. Some lawmakers, including Senator Charles Schumer of New York, have called on the FAA to ease flying restrictions so drones can be used for a wider array of business applications. Lawmakers have also argued that restrictions on outdoor drone testing have put U.S. companies at a disadvantage to foreign rivals, which operate in less restrictive climates overseas. Some industry executives say low-end drones like DJI\u0027s risk becoming commoditized and that the more promising market lies in high-end services such as thermal imaging and 3D mapping. DJI says it has plans to expand into more sophisticated drones. (Reporting by David Morgan, Editing by Soyoung Kim and Stuart Grudgings)",

      "articleBody": "* West Africa produces 70 percent of world\u0027s cocoa * African chocolatiers forced to import key ingredients * Madagascar chocolate company exports to U.S. By Edith Honan DAR ES SALAAM, April 17 (Reuters) - Jaki Kweka is that rare breed of gourmet chocolatier. She makes fine chocolate in Africa using local African ingredients. Other African companies such as Ghana\u0027s Golden Tree use local cocoa but import milk powder and sugar. Multinationals such as Nestle mass produce chocolate in South Africa for the continent\u0027s consumers and source ingredients globally. But few firms match Kweka\u0027s ideal -- she uses Tanzanian beans and local sugar to make organic chocolate that is 100 percent African. She packages her bars in recycled maize husks for extra authenticity. Kweka\u0027s Chocolate Mamas is one of a handful of East African firms carving out a niche in the chocolate world and seeking to reverse a trend that has led to the foreign domination of Africa\u0027s growing chocolate economy. The firm employs five people and its small size sheds light on a big issue: Africa produces more than 70 percent of the world\u0027s cocoa but the $110 billion chocolate industry is dominated by Western companies. Top cocoa producers Ivory Coast and Ghana lack dairy and sugar industries to compete with the main manufacturers and cocoa is traded globally so African bean growers don\u0027t have a competitive advantage when it comes to making chocolate. \"You don\u0027t really find large-scale chocolate manufacturing (by African companies) in sub-Saharan Africa because it\u0027s not commercially viable. It\u0027s expensive to produce,\" said Victoria Crandall, an Ecobank analyst in Ivory Coast. Chocolate Mamas\u0027 dark and milk chocolate bars sell at premium prices in high-end shops and hotels in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar and they have a devoted following among wealthy Tanzanians, expatriates and tourists. The company launched in 2012 and Kweka began using cocoa from small-scale farmers in southwestern Tanzania after seeing the price of importing baking chocolate from Europe. It took nine months of trial and error to perfect recipes. \"We found out a lot of things, including that heat and humidity don\u0027t go very well with making chocolate,\" said Kweka, a lawyer turned pastry chef. A few months ago she and her business partner opened a store at an upmarket shopping plaza in Dar es Salaam with views of the Indian Ocean. \"There is so much unexhausted potential for making things that are not on the market here,\" she said. ABSOLUTE CHOCOLATE Chocolate consumption in sub-Saharan Africa is on the rise. Sales in South Africa, the continent\u0027s largest market, rose to 6.4 billion rand ($531 million) in 2014 from 5.8 billion rand in 2013, according to market research firm Nielsen. South Africa, which does not produce cocoa on a large scale, is also the continent\u0027s biggest chocolate producer. Aside from Nestle, Mondelez and Lindt also have factories. The most prominent mass-market chocolate maker in West Africa is Ghana\u0027s Cocoa Processing Company, which makes around 1,000 tonnes of chocolate per year under its Golden Tree label. Street hawkers sell the bars, some for less than a dollar, and they contain an ingredient to stop melting in the hot sun. Golden Tree serves a domestic market and is yet to export its products successfully. On that score, Africa\u0027s most successful wholly-local chocolate brand may be Madecasse, a company founded in Madagascar in 2006. Peace Corps volunteers established it to help farmers make money from the island nation\u0027s coveted cocoa and vanilla. Its idealistic origins are a key to its success and an indication of how tough it is to drive an African chocolate business. The bars, which cost $6, sell at Whole Foods and other gourmet food outlets in the United States, though they are not on sale yet in their country of origin where the price could limit their appeal. \"We have ambitions to scale considerably but for us it\u0027s always a question of getting the right ... investors,\" said Tim McCollum, a founder and CEO of Madecasse who is based in New York. In Kenya, Naheed Ahmed started Absolute Chocolate in November soon after getting his first taste of fine chocolate at culinary school in South Africa. He now makes 100 kilograms a month, selling his chili-infused truffles from under glass cases at a shop made to look like a jewellery store in Nairobi\u0027s upscale Village Market. His nearby factory shows how distant is the dream of an all-African chocolate bar: The machines are Italian, the praline moulds come from Belgium and the sea salt comes from England. The cocoa comes from Ghana, however. It\u0027s virtually the only African input. ($1 \u003d 12.0433 rand) (Additional reporting and editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg; editing by Giles Elgood)",

      "articleBody": "MEXICO CITY, April 16 (Reuters) - Mexico has awarded a $75 million highway contract to a company closely linked to a contractor that was banned from government work after botching two projects, including a job on the same highway. The Communications and Transport Ministry awarded the road contract late last year to a business named Epccor. Epccor is owned by the sons of Juan Diego Gutierrez Cortina, who controls a company that is on the government\u0027s list of banned businesses. Among the ties between the two companies, one of the sons serves as a director of both firms, a public filing shows. A Reuters investigation earlier this year found Gutierrez Cortina\u0027s company, Gutsa Infraestructura, is among dozens of contractors that have won work with state oil company Pemex even after being barred from contracting by the Public Administration Ministry. Some banned companies have changed their names and shareholders in order to win new contracts. Mexican law prohibits government entities from contracting with companies that have shareholders directly or indirectly in common with banned contractors. Epccor itself hasn\u0027t been banned. A spokesman for the transport ministry said it does not sign contracts with banned companies. The spokesman did not respond to questions about the ties between Epccor and Gutsa. Epccor, in partnership with a Spanish company called Construcciones Aldesem, won a 1.045 billion peso contract to widen a 14.5 kilometer (9 mile) bypass around the city of Cuernavaca on the Mexico City-Acapulco highway. The partners presented the lowest eligible bid. Gutsa and Epccor \"are completely different companies,\" said Epccor vice president Adolfo Gomez. He said Gutsa was a major construction firm with many employees, and it is only natural that some should have joined Epccor. Gomez himself once worked at Gutsa. Officials at Aldesem did not respond to emails or phone calls. One of Gutierrez Cortina\u0027s sons, Ignacio Gutierrez Sainz, is a director of both Epccor and Gutsa, according to a public financial document from last year. Gutierrez Sainz and two of Gutierrez Cortina\u0027s other sons are shareholders in Epccor. Epccor has shared an office address and a legal representative with Gutsa, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. Six Epccor employees on the Web site LinkedIn list Gutsa as their previous employer. Epccor has changed its address, said Gomez, the Epccor vice president. It is now in a building behind Gutsa\u0027s old building. He noted that Epccor itself is not suspended from government contracting. Mexico\u0027s Public Administration Ministry, which maintains the list of banned contractors, said in a written statement that an independent auditor oversaw the bid process for the Cuernavaca bypass. The ministry didn\u0027t respond to questions about the relationship between Epccor and Gutsa. Mexico\u0027s Federal Audit Office in 2012 found that Gutsa bungled a $30 million Pemex contract to build a monument to mark the bicentennial of Mexican independence. Gutsa did not finish the monument, known as the Estela de Luz, in time for the anniversary, and the costs ballooned to more than $90 million, the office found. Investigators later found that Gutsa won the monument contract by taking advantage of a regulatory loophole. The company received that contract while it was appealing a previous ban over shoddy work on the Mexico City-Acapulco highway. The independent auditor who reviewed the highway contract recently won by Epccor did not find any irregularities in the process of awarding the deal. But he warned the transport ministry of potential problems, noting that there was confusion in the contract proposal over the degree to which the road was to be widened. \"This bid process is happening without the certainty that it can be completed in the time and within the originally considered budget,\" he added. Epccor\u0027s Gomez did not immediately respond to questions about the auditor\u0027s warning. (Additional reporting by M.B. Pell in New York)",

The 28-country bloc has already introduced rules on how to wind down troubled banks without turning to taxpayers for cash. It now wants a similar regime for other so-called systemic financial market participants. EU financial services commissioner Jonathan Hill told Reuters in an interview that he would shortly set out a system specifically for dealing with failed clearing houses ahead of a draft law due to be completed later in the year. He said the issue had become pressing due to reforms to make the $700 trillion derivatives market safer by channelling these financial instruments through clearers, third party organisations that ensure derivatives trades are completed even if one side of the deal goes bust. Clearing houses like Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet are set to grow significantly, thus posing risks to financial stability if they collapsed. \"Previous reforms have introduced greater transparency and concentrated risk in clearing houses and therefore we need to think more carefully how you would resolve them,\" Hill said. Financial market participants have pushed for a separate regime for clearers and have warned against a \"one size fits all\" approach to resolving financial firms outside the banking industry. Hill said the EU executive would adopt a proposal for an new EU law later in the year. \"We will be setting out alongside that what our approach would be to other non-bank entities that might present risks, such as insurers and asset managers,\" Hill said. \"The view I have taken is, where the case is strongest with clearing houses we should act early, and where we need to assemble the evidence, to take our time to form a proper risk-based view of things, we can come back to ... at a later date.\" \"There is going to be a differentiated approach on that, which is a new development,\" Hill said.

Emirates cancelled an order for 70 A350 aircraft last year, saying the new plane from Airbus did not fit its original specifications, but later launched a new purchasing process.

In February, China\u0027s two leading taxi-hailing apps Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache agreed to merge, creating a $6 billion company. New York-listed 58.com, dubbed the Craigslist of China and backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, said it would issue 34 million new ordinary shares and pay $412.2 million in cash to acquire the stake in Ganji.com. At the current market price, the deal is valued at $1.6 billion, according to Reuters calculations. A person with direct knowledge of the matter however said the acquisition price was about $1.2 billion. 58.com declined to comment on the acquisition value. 58.com is buying the stake from Ganji.com shareholders including private equity firms Tiger Global Management, Carlyle Group and CITIC Capital, venture capital firms Sequoia Capital, Nokia Growth Partners and Ganji.com\u0027s employees and management, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter. Boutique investment firm China Renaissance advised the selling shareholders, that person said. At the same time, social networking firm Tencent will invest about $400 million in 58.com, leaving its stake at roughly 25.1 percent, 58.com said. Both deals are expected to close \"within a few days\", the advertising site said in a statement on Friday. Last year, Tencent, China\u0027s biggest social networking and online entertainment firm, bought a 20 percent stake in 58.com for $736 million, as part of a drive to boost its e-commerce business. The deal with Ganji.com is aimed at integrating the two businesses to decrease costs while bolstering revenues, 58.com CEO Michael Yao was quoted as saying in the statement. The firms will operate their own brands, websites and teams, according to the statement. \"We have seen and continue to see the mobile internet enabling a transformative opportunity in the classified industry,\" said Ganji.com CEO Mark Yang in the statement. In a separate letter to employees, the authenticity of which was confirmed by a 58.com spokeswoman, CEO Yao was quoted as saying that the two companies would merge and he and Ganji.com\u0027s Yang would be co-chief executives of the new firm. A Tencent spokeswoman declined to comment on its investment in 58.com. A representative for Ganji.com was not available for immediate comment.

      "articleBody": "LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - The prospect of deeper interest rate cuts took Russia\u0027s rouble more than 2 percent lower on Friday, knocking it off 4-1/2-month highs against the dollar, while Russian equity markets also slipped. The rouble touched a low of 51.2 per dollar after central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said late on Thursday the currency had found its equilibrium and its appreciation provided a basis for further rate cuts. After slumping to around 80 per dollar in late 2014, the rouble has rallied as the oil market shows signs of having bottomed out and fighting in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces has eased. \"The rouble has appreciated so much recently that from the point of view of the central bank and government it makes sense to try and cap it so as not to erode too much the competitiveness gains they got from the depreciation,\" said Sebastien Barbe, head of emerging market strategy at Credit Agricole in Paris. After markets close on Friday, Standard \u0026 Poor\u0027s and Fitch are due to publish ratings for Russia. Downgrades are seen as unlikely because of the more stable economic conditions seen in recent months. Russian dollar-denominated stocks fell 1.5 percent and the rouble index also slipped as oil prices came down from 2015 highs, but they are up some 16 percent this month. The likelihood of rate cuts may boost local bonds though, with 10-year yields touching a new 4-1/2 month low around 10.3 percent. Broader emerging market stocks also paused in a rally that earlier took the MSCI emerging markets index to a new seven-month high. Though the benchmark gave up earlier gains to fall 0.2 percent, it was still headed for a third consecutive weekly gain after lackluster economic data in the United States persuaded more investors a rate hike from the Federal Reserve is less imminent than once thought. The Asia Pacific ex-Japan index eased 0.2 percent but stayed near seven-year highs after a 2.3 percent gain for Shanghai shares. In emerging Europe, Turkish stocks rose 0.8 percent while the lira fell 0.3 percent approaching the record lows hit earlier this week on back of pre-election tensions. Hungary\u0027s forint remained under pressure near a three-week low against the euro after the European Union suspended a development fund payment over concerns about how Budapest allocated the money.

Inc (TVIRD), a Philippine nickel miner partly owned by Canada\u0027s TVI Pacific Inc, may push back a planned initial public offering to next year if metal prices remain depressed, its chairman said on Friday. After a sterling performance in 2014, shares in Philippine nickel miners have fallen this year because of a slump in metal prices and an economic slowdown in China. Shares in top producer and exporter Nickel Asia Corp have lost nearly 39 percent. \"The target is to list in the fourth quarter. But right now I would not be recommending to the board that we do it,\" TVIRD Chairman Clifford James told reporters after speaking at an industry forum. \"When market conditions are good, that\u0027s when we\u0027ll list.\" In October, TVIRD began nickel ore exports from its newly developed Agata mine in Surigao province in southern Philippines, a major nickel-producing region supplying ore to processing plants in Australia, China, South Korea and Japan. Last year the Southeast Asian country became the biggest ore supplier to China\u0027s producers of nickel pig iron, which is used in stainless steel production, after Indonesia banned exports of unprocessed metallic minerals. TVIRD is one of two Philippine nickel miners looking to raise funds from share sales this year to finance projects. Global Ferronickel Holdings Inc, the country\u0027s No. 3 producer by output, has sought regulatory approval for a follow-on issue to raise up to $400 million. James said TVIRD had yet to decide how much it wanted to raise from the IPO, which it intends to use to finance expansion projects and the construction of a nickel processing plant. The miner is looking to build what could be the country\u0027s third nickel processing plant. James said the IPO would also depend on planned government measures such as higher mining taxes and a halt to ore exports, similar to the Indonesian ban. \"We want to see some certainty in government policy,\" he said. The proposed reforms may weigh on TVIRD\u0027s valuation, especially if they appear likely to get parliamentary approval before next year\u0027s elections, he said. However, TVIRD planned to export more than 2.5 million wet metric tonnes of nickel ore this year, which James believed would support the company\u0027s valuation.

Glybera, designed to treat a very rare blood disease, came with a preliminary price tag of 1.1 million euros ($1.2 million), before standard German drug pricing discounts. German body G-BA was due to issue an assessment of the drug\u0027s benefits by the end of this month but it said late on Thursday it had decided to miss the legal deadline to get more clarity on the drug\u0027s benefits. An adviser for biotech drugs to the European Medicines Agency, a so-called rapporteur, last week said in a report that Glybera, which is marketed by UniQure\u0027s unlisted Italian marketing partner Chiesi, lacked efficacy. \"Even if the suspension of the procedure violates the legal deadline, the decision is justified and without alternative,\" G-BA head Josef Hecken said in a statement. \"Judging from the statements about the rapporteur\u0027s report, his findings must be worrisome.\" The European Medicines Agency\u0027s CHMP committee will consider the rapporteur\u0027s report on Glybera at its regular monthly meeting in London next week. The drug has already had a tortuous journey to market as regulators have struggled to assess its effectiveness because of the very small number of patients available for clinical tests. The G-BA\u0027s verdict on the drug benefits will play a key role in future negotiations about the reimbursement price between the drug companies and Germany\u0027s statutory health insurance funds. Glybera fights a genetic disease called lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD) that clogs the blood with fat. The medicine was approved in Europe two years ago but its launch was delayed to allow for the collection of six-year follow-up data on its benefits.

Argentina\u0027s minister for the Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, announced the start of the lawsuit in London on Friday, saying a judge in Rio Grande, Argentina, had agreed to take on the case. The main companies involved in oil drilling in the Falklands are Premier Oil, Noble Energy, Falkland Oil and Gas, Rockhopper and Edison International . Daniel Filmus told a press conference at the residence of the Argentine ambassador to London that his country was determined to use international and national law to pursue the case. He said the proceedings had been brought against three UK-listed firms and two firms listed in the United States. He said anyone found guilty of illegal exploration in Argentina would face a sentence of 5 to 10 years in prison, while sentences for illegal extraction would be even longer. The judge will now decide how to proceed. Earlier this month, Falklands oil explorers Premier Oil and Falkland Oil and Gas kickstarted their 2015 drilling campaign by announcing they had found oil and gas at the first well in a nine-month programme. In response, Argentina said it would start legal proceedings against the energy firms, leading to the two countries summoning each other\u0027s ambassadors for a dressing down. The Falkland Islands Government said it had a right to develop its own economy. \"Exploration drilling has been happening in Falkland Islands waters for many years,\" it said. \"The Government of Argentina continues to ignore our inalienable right to determine our own future.\" It is the latest diplomatic spat between Britain and Argentina, who fought a short war over the Falklands in 1982 which Britain won. The war killed more than 600 Argentine and 255 British soldiers. (Reporting by Karolin Schapps; writing by Kate Holton; editing by Estelle Shirbon)",

The possibility that Athens might not be able to meet payments to the International Monetary Fund - which could mean default and eventually an exit from the euro zone - has pushed up Greek bond yields but sparked few ripple effects globally. A U.S. interest rate hike in the near term is now seen as less likely after a recent run of lackluster U.S. economic data that sent the dollar down for a fourth straight day on Friday to near a one-week low. At the same time, lingering worries about upcoming corporate earnings reports in the United States have been offset by corporate share buybacks, according to analysts and investors. \"The equity market does appear to have looked through the weakness in economic data and earnings with extraordinary aplomb,\" said Sean Darby, global equity strategist at Jefferies, in a note to clients. \"(U.S.) share buybacks have become a much more important driver for stock prices in the short-run as earnings-per-share growth wanes.\" General Electric is expected to report results before the start of trading on Friday. U.S. consumer inflation data is also due, and may reinforce the view that a near-term rise in rates is less likely. The MSCI All-Country World index was up 0.17 percent at 0846 GMT, near all-time highs hit earlier this week, with European and Asian equities slipping slightly but still near multi-year peaks. The Shanghai Composite Index surged 2.6 percent, set for a 6 percent weekly rise. German 10-year yields hit a new all-time low of 0.073 percent, creeping closer to zero, even as Greece sounded a mix of defiance and willingness to compromise with its international creditors on reforms required to unlock more loans. Greek yields and shares were slightly higher. Emerging market stocks hit a new seven-month high and headed for their third consecutive weekly gain, helped by expectations that a U.S. rate hike was further away than once thought. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart, a voting member of the Fed\u0027s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent \"murky\" run of U.S. data has him leaning against a June interest rate hike. Lockhart quickly added he was confident the economy would remain on track. Comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren also struck dovish tones. The rate-rise uncertainty left gold prices facing their second straight weekly drop, while London tin capitulated to more than five-year lows as growing supply from Myanmar and torpid demand punished prices. Brent crude oil prices fell on Friday, ending a run of rallies earlier in the week, after OPEC said that its output surged in March, adding to a global glut.

      "articleBody": "(Rewrites throughout) By Michael Martina and Gerry Shih BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - China\u0027s bank regulator temporarily suspended this week new financial industry cybersecurity rules after feedback from banks, showing the practical challenges of the nation\u0027s long-term effort to cut dependence on entrenched foreign technology. In a notice issued on Monday and reviewed by Reuters, Chinese regulators said the decision on the rules, which would have effectively replaced foreign tech products with domestic alternatives, came after \"financial institutions in the banking industry and related parties put forward opinions for improvements and proposed changes\". Although U.S. technology firms, business lobbies and the White House have been the most vocal critics of the new rules, analysts say key opposition also likely came from within Chinese banks themselves, which like their peers around the world run critical operations on industry-standard products, from IBM servers to Oracle Corp databases. \"The banks themselves have a limited acceptance of domestic IT products,\" said Forrester analyst Gene Cao. \"The banks want to avoid failures. For the banks, if there was a failure because of domestic equipment, the responsibility would be on them, not necessarily the CBRC.\" The notice from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said the rules will be re-issued after they are amended but did not say how long the process would take. The CBRC and the ministry declined to provide immediate comment on Friday. China has recently advanced a wave of new policies to tighten cybersecurity roughly 18 months after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed that U.S. spy agencies planted code in American tech exports to snoop on overseas targets. The Chinese policies, most clearly articulated in the bank-technology rules and a proposed counter-terrorism law, call for greater use of \"secure and controllable\" technology products that are developed in China or have released their source code to Chinese inspectors. Foreign business groups and governments argue the rules are unfair and motivated by protectionism and would hamper Chinese business operations. The United States said on Friday it welcomed the decision. \"We understand China has issued an official notice to its banking sector, suspending banking measures that impose serious restrictions on foreign firms. Premier Li, in my meeting with him on Monday, conveyed this decision to me personally. We welcome this suspension,\" U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker said in emailed comments to Reuters. DRY RUNS Anticipating the official announcement of the bank rules last December, technology departments at China\u0027s large banks have been testing running Chinese equipment since early last year, mostly with non-critical operations, according to people with knowledge of the matter. \"I think the government concern is reasonable, but it\u0027s technically impossible to comply with such rules,\" said a banker at a foreign bank in China who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The notice came on the same day when 31 foreign trade associations urged Chinese leaders to \"suspend implementation of the guidelines through a written public notice...and initiate a formal public consultation consistent with China\u0027s international obligations\". Analysts say there is little doubt that Chinese leaders are committed to weaning the country off foreign technology and developing domestic contenders as a long-term ambition. China is also working on an anti-terrorism law that would require foreign companies to hand over encryption keys, triggering U.S. protests. Reuters reported in March that China had agreed to delay implementing the technology restrictions, which have grown to become a major irritant in U.S.-China relations. Washington has said it is working with allies in Europe and Japan to break down the Chinese barriers and had requested through the World Trade Organization that Beijing clarify the banking technology rules.

Western sanctions against Russia, and Rosneft in particular, have raised concerns about the proposed $4.1 billion deal and have already forced the Russian oil group to cancel several North Atlantic Drilling contracts.. \"Today, all parties have mutually agreed to extend the termination date ... whereby any party can terminate the framework agreement and/or any offshore drilling contracts at any time prior to May 31, 2017, at no cost,\" North Atlantic Drilling said in a statement. The companies also agreed to renegotiate the terms after rig rates collapsed with the 50 percent fall in crude oil prices and deep investment cuts by explorers. Under the deal, which had already been delayed to May this year, North Atlantic Drilling would buy about 150 land rigs from Rosneft. The Russian oil giant, meanwhile, would take a stake of about 30 percent in North Atlantic Drilling. Seadrill, which currently holds 71 percent of North Atlantic Drilling, would remain the majority shareholder. An earlier deal included six offshore contracts, two of which were terminated by Rosneft last month. North Atlantic Drilling said its rigs included in the agreement are free to sign binding contracts with other companies and it is also allowed to delay construction and delivery of any of the rigs.

SKF shares fell 4.8 percent after the Swedish company forecast flat demand for its products in the second quarter, while Syngenta declined by 3 percent after reporting lower sales. Both SKF and Syngenta were among the worst performers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, which has risen nearly 20 percent since the start of 2015. On the positive side, French electronic systems company Thales rose 2.4 percent after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the company to \"buy\" from \"neutral\", while higher sales enabled hotels group Accor\u0027s shares to rise. Greece on Thursday sounded a mix of defiance and willingness to compromise with its international creditors on reforms required to unlock more loans, as it faces running out of money ahead of debt repayments next month. Athens\u0027 benchmark stock index edged up 0.5 percent on Friday, but the Greek stock market remains down around 9 percent since the start of the year. \"I think the Greece situation will be resolved but we\u0027ve had a massive up-turn on the stock markets so far this year, and the underlying concerns are causing some people to take a bit of money off the table,\" said Darren Courtney-Cook, head of trading at Central Markets Investment Management. Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu added that a slight rebound in the euro on currency markets was also resulting in the European stock market rally losing a bit of steam. The region\u0027s exporters have benefited this year from a slide in the euro partly caused by new economic stimulus measures from the European Central Bank (ECB). \"We are consolidating a little bit after the rally due to the fears about Greece and the rebound in the euro. It\u0027s anybody\u0027s guess at this point as to what will happen with Greece,\" he said.

      "articleBody": "LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - An experimental drug comprising of a high-dose formulation of the food additive biotin has successfully helped patients with progressive multiple sclerosis in a major clinical trial, its French maker said on Friday. Biotin, also known as vitamin H, is already an approved food additive but the pharmaceutical-grade dose used in biotech company MedDay\u0027s drug MD1003 is 300 mg a day, which is 10,000 times the recommended daily food intake. While there have been a number of recent advances in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), there are currently no effective treatments to slow or stop the gradual increase in disability in people with progressive MS. The progressive form the disease affects around 40 percent of MS patients. MedDay said a pivotal Phase III study with MD1003 met its goal of improving disability scores in patients after nine months and one year of treatment, potentially paving the way for the medicine to reach the market next year. Full details of the study results will be present at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Washington on April 24. If all goes to plan, MedDay\u0027s drug could reach the market ahead of rival products in development at other companies, including Biogen\u0027s BII033, which is currently in Phase II clinical testing. Although biotin is not a newly invented chemical, MedDay has U.S. and European patents protecting the dose and its use for MS. The privately owned company was founded in 2011 by neurologist Frederic Sedel. Two years later, it raised 8 million euros ($8.6 million) from venture capital groups InnoBio and Sofinnova Partners, enough to fund operations until 2016.

      "articleBody": "(Adds CEO comments, debt figure; paragraphs 4, 9-10, 12) By Gleb Stolyarov and Olga Popova MOSCOW, April 17 (Reuters) - Russian railcar manufacturer United Wagon Company plans to float at least 10 percent of its shares on the Moscow exchange, it said on Friday, representing Russia\u0027s first initial public offering (IPO) in more than a year. The company, part of the ICT Group headed by Russian billionaire Alexander Nesis, expects to raise about $200 million, a source close to the deal said, achieving a market valuation of about $2 billion. Approximately half of the offered stake will be new shares, with the rest provided by sole shareholder United Wagon Plc, which is also owned by Nesis, the company said in a statement. Chief Executive Roman Savushkin said the company had several anchor investors, including investment firms, but would not name them. A recommended share price will be announced on April 29, another source said. Russia\u0027s most recent IPO was by budget hypermarket chain Lenta in February last year, weeks before Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The resulting Western sanctions over Russia\u0027s involvement in Ukraine and a collapse in global oil prices have hit the Russian economy hard, with the central bank forecasting a contraction of 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year. United Wagon Company, however, sees opportunities in the outdated Russian railway industry, using proceeds from its market debut to finance development, Savushkin said. \"We are focused on fairly aggressive growth,\" he said. \"Firstly, the expansion of our fleet ... Secondly, the extension of our product line, introducing new types of cars.\" The CEO said there was growing demand for United Wagon\u0027s railcars to replace Russia\u0027s ageing rolling stock, 35 percent of which the company expects to be written off in the next seven years. The company reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 3.6 billion roubles ($71.4 million) last year, up almost 90 percent on 2013. Its 2014 EBITDA margin, a measure of profitability, was about 21 percent, and its net debt is 90 billion roubles, the company said.

      "articleBody": "SYDNEY, April 17 (Reuters) - Embattled Australian satellite firm NewSat was placed in administration on Friday, just weeks after a major lender withdrew support for a planned $650-million satellite launch, throwing its viability into doubt. Funding for the launch of Australia\u0027s only privately owned commercial satellite was suspended last year after financial irregularities were uncovered and Melbourne-based NewSat needed waivers from its backers to get new loan instalments. But a key lender, Europe\u0027s COFACE Lender Group, pulled out of the deal this month, raising fresh questions about the company\u0027s fiscal viability. Insolvency firm McGrath Nichol has taken control of the company and its assets, it said in a statement, and a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction have been issued against the firm. \"The receivers\u0027 immediate priority is to take control of the assets of NewSat, urgently assess its financial position and progress the capital raising activities recently commenced by the company,\" said McGrath Nichol partner Jason Preston. \"In the interim, the operations of NewSat will continue on a business-as-usual basis.\" The move calls into question the launch of Australia\u0027s only privately owned commercial satellite, Jabiru-1, which could be a blow for the U.S. Export Import Bank, the other primary lender funding the Lockheed Martin-built satellite. Ex-Im Bank is fighting for survival over criticism that the 80-year-old institution, which has recently invested heavily in satellites, favours corporate giants over small businesses. A funding shortfall had stopped NewSat from paying its launch provider, France\u0027s Arianespace, which in turn issued the Australian communications firm a termination notice with a 30-day deadline. Although Lockheed has not stopped building Jabiru-1, NewSat said this month that the funding issues could lead the U.S. aerospace giant to terminate its satellite manufacturing agreement, resulting in the project\u0027s collapse.

The link-up was for technical services and did not involve equity cooperation, China Petroleum \u0026 Chemical Corp , or Sinopec, said on its official microblog. It did not say how much money was involved. Cooperation between Alibaba, a poster child for private enterprise in China, and one of the country\u0027s biggest state-owned companies dovetails with government policy. Sinopec and other state behemoths have been under pressure to make better use of information technology and take advantage of cloud computing and big data to better track things like supply, demand and emissions. Alibaba, whose $25 billion initial public offering in New York in September was the biggest on record, has been leveraging its good standing with the government to forge cloud computing agreements with various government or state-run bodies. \"By helping Sinopec with digitization and big data technologies, we hope we can play a part to help bring about greener solutions and new business opportunities,\" Allen Zhang, director at Alibaba\u0027s cloud computing business Aliyun, said in an emailed statement. The cooperation between Aliyun and Sinopec would help upgrade some of the oil company\u0027s traditional petrochemical services, Sinopec said. Aliyun is helping Sinopec build cloud-based business systems and perform data analytics covering the entire petrochemical production chain, Aliyun said. The two companies were also exploring cooperation in areas including the so-called Internet of things, vehicle networking, finance and online payments, e-commerce and online-to-offline commerce. Aliyun is China\u0027s biggest cloud services provider with about a 23 percent market share. (Reporting by John Ruwitch)",

      "articleBody": "* About-face after buying coal power stations in 2014 * Will add to pressure on Australia\u0027s coal industry * Environmental lobby sceptical (Adds reaction from environmentalists, background) By Byron Kaye SYDNEY, April 17 (Reuters) - AGL Energy Ltd, Australia\u0027s No.2 power retailer and its biggest carbon polluter, said on Friday it would not buy any more coal-fired power stations and would close all its existing coal-fired power plants by 2050. The company, which became Australia\u0027s biggest owner of coal-fired power stations when it bought two plants from New South Wales state for A$1.5 billion ($1.17 billion) in 2014, announced the apparent about-face in a new \"greenhouse gas policy\". Although the shutdowns may be far in the future, the AGL policy introduces a domestic element to a slowdown already confronting the Australian coal industry as exports to China drop and that country shifts towards cleaner energy options. It also suggests that AGL, which has campaigned in the past to lower a national renewable energy target, wants to show it can contribute to greenhouse gas reduction without the need for government regulation. The conservative government and centre-left opposition have been deadlocked since last year on whether to lower the renewable energy target, while AGL has suggested the target be rethought completely. Coal delivers nearly two-thirds of Australia\u0027s energy and AGL has stakes in three of the country\u0027s biggest coal-fired power stations. It sells energy to nearly 4 million people, a sixth of the population. AGL\u0027s recently appointed chief executive officer, Andy Vesey, said the company\u0027s move out of coal-fired power would be \"an ongoing, progressive process, managing the efficient operations of our assets, and the transition of our people into new generation technologies and careers\". \"It is important that government policy incentivises investment in lower-emitting technology while at the same time ensuring that older, less efficient and reliable power stations are removed from Australia\u0027s energy mix,\" he said in a statement. However, the move won only grudging praise from environmentalists. \"It\u0027s good that they\u0027re finally listening to the nine out of 10 Australians who want more renewable energy but it\u0027s a shame that they\u0027re going to keep pumping carbon into the atmosphere until 2050, when most of their dirty power plants would have been shut anyway,\" said James Grugeon, director of market impacts at GetUp!, an activist group. \"It\u0027s a step forward after several steps backwards.\" Nick Brass, director at Energy Matters Pty Ltd, a solar power firm owned by Sunedison Inc, said the policy was well-meaning but added: \"Coal power by 2050 is not going to be an economic issue, let alone a climate issue. They\u0027re taking the opportunity to get a nice bit of PR from a fact.\" AGL shares were down 1.1 percent in afternoon trade, in line with the broader Australian share market.

      "articleBody": "(Repeating to additional subscribers without changes to text) By David Henry and Lauren Tara LaCapra NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - U.S. banks are reporting that companies are tapping more of their credit lines to fund hiring and expand their businesses, a promising sign for the economy. Commercial borrowers are using two or three percentage points more of their credit lines than they were a year ago, reaching levels not seen since before the financial crisis was at its height in 2009, senior officials at a number of major banks said in interviews and on conference calls this week. Companies are using the funds for a variety of things, from boosting manufacturing capacity to investing in new businesses and building inventory as customer demand increases. \"Confidence is back,\" said Laura Oberst, an executive vice president at Wells Fargo \u0026 Co who oversees commercial banking for the central U.S. region. \"It\u0027s fragile still, but stronger than I\u0027ve seen it since the meltdown of 2008.\" A Wells Fargo spokeswoman could not immediately provide a bank-wide utilization rate for commercial and industrial borrowers, but said it has gone up a few percentage points over the past year. Bank of America Corp Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson said commercial and industrial borrowers were using \"in the high 30s\" percent of their credit lines last quarter, the highest in six years and up from a range \"in the very low 30s\" during the recession. The bank declined to comment on where levels stood a year ago. The increased usage represented about $1 billion worth of loan growth over the past year in Bank of America\u0027s commercial lending business, Thompson told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday. While companies in distress - such as energy companies hit by the plunging oil price - often use lines of credit for emergency funding, that was not where most of the demand for Bank of America funds was coming from, Thompson said. Bank of America is the second largest U.S. bank by assets. At JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co, the largest U.S. bank, corporate borrowers were using 34 percent of credit the bank extended to them last quarter, up 2.8 percentage points from a year earlier and 4 percentage points higher than in all of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it was the highest utilization rate since 2009. Even banks that have not seen customers using more of their credit lines, such as USBancorp, are seeing some encouraging signs. Companies have asked the Minneapolis-based regional bank to increase their lines of credit, and USBancorp\u0027s outstanding commitments for loans have grown by 12 percent over the last year, CFO Kathy Rogers told Reuters in an interview. That increase usually points to rising confidence that they will need more funds, she added. UNEVEN EXPANSION Overall U.S. economic growth, and corporate spending growth, has been patchy since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In 2014, for example, expenditure on equipment grew over the whole year by 6.4 percent, according to gross domestic product data. But on a quarterly basis, annualized and adjusted for seasonal differences, changes in expenditure swung wildly - ranged from a contraction of 1 percent to growth of 11.2 percent. For banks, any increased demand for the credit lines, also known as \"revolvers,\" is a positive. Lenders charge companies relatively low fees on unused lines. \"As they use those revolvers more, we are getting paid more for those commitments that are already out there,\" Bank of America\u0027s Thompson said. In the near term, though, there is a risk that competition among lenders will drive down borrowing rates further, pressuring bank profits even as loan books expand. \"We\u0027re chasing our tail because there\u0027s a lot more competition,\" said Wells Fargo\u0027s Oberst. Credit lines usage is one factor that influence bank earnings, but there are many others. Bank earnings have been mixed this week, with JPMorgan posting a big increase in quarterly earnings thanks to higher trading revenues, while Wells Fargo, PNC Financial Services, and other banks have posted weaker results thanks in part to falling medium- and long-term lending rates.

Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it was the highest utilization rate since 2009. Even banks that have not seen customers using more of their credit lines, such as USBancorp, are seeing some encouraging signs. Companies have asked the Minneapolis-based regional bank to increase their lines of credit, and USBancorp\u0027s outstanding commitments for loans have grown by 12 percent over the last year, CFO Kathy Rogers told Reuters in an interview. That increase usually points to rising confidence that they will need more funds, she added. UNEVEN EXPANSION Overall U.S. economic growth, and corporate spending growth, has been patchy since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. In 2014, for example, expenditure on equipment grew over the whole year by 6.4 percent, according to gross domestic product data. But on a quarterly basis, annualized and adjusted for seasonal differences, changes in expenditure swung wildly - ranged from a contraction of 1 percent to growth of 11.2 percent. For banks, any increased demand for the credit lines, also known as \"revolvers,\" is a positive. Lenders charge companies relatively low fees on unused lines. \"As they use those revolvers more, we are getting paid more for those commitments that are already out there,\" Bank of America\u0027s Thompson said. In the near term, though, there is a risk that competition among lenders will drive down borrowing rates further, pressuring bank profits even as loan books expand. \"We\u0027re chasing our tail because there\u0027s a lot more competition,\" said Wells Fargo\u0027s Oberst. Credit lines usage is one factor that influence bank earnings, but there are many others. Bank earnings have been mixed this week, with JPMorgan posting a big increase in quarterly earnings thanks to higher trading revenues, while Wells Fargo, PNC Financial Services, and other banks have posted weaker results thanks in part to falling medium- and long-term lending rates.

      "articleBody": "WILLISTON, N.D., April 17 (Reuters) - Calpers, the largest American public pension fund, and nearly 60 other institutional investors will ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday to require oil and natural gas companies to publish detailed analysis of the risks posed by climate change to their business models. The letter, also signed several U.S. state treasurers, asks SEC Chair Mary Jo White to require oil producers to publish \"meaningful, substantive carbon asset risk disclosures,\" much in the way they already disclose information on factors outside their control, such as commodity and currency price swings. Some oil companies provide general information already about how much they could lose if climate change worsens and regulation or cultural shifts reduce consumption. This letter seeks concrete details about how they reached those conclusions. Calpers and other investors will tell the SEC more specifics are needed to better gauge whether to invest in the sector, according to a draft letter seen by Reuters. \"I would be surprised if companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are not doing some kind of internal analysis already of what the impact on their reserves would be if we change our fossil fuel use,\" said Shanna Cleveland of nonprofit Ceres that worked with investors to craft the letter. \"It\u0027s that kind of information, the really technical, down-in-the-weeds information, that investors are trying to get to.\" The letter was timed to coincide with the Monday start of IHS CERAWeek in Houston, the world\u0027s largest energy conference where major oil executives, politicians and regulators will appear. With crude prices down more than half since last summer, pressure is on the sector to justify costly oil and natural gas projects. Getting access to specific climate change data, the investors hope, may show that the sector has a cost advantage to invest more in solar and wind projects. The request comes the day after Calpers sponsored a successful shareholder resolution at BP\u0027s annual meeting that requires the oil company to begin stress-testing its operations against climate change risks. Exxon, the world\u0027s largest publicly traded oil company, said last year climate change poses little risk to its reserves, but agreed to start providing some information about how it arrived at this conclusion. \"Fossil fuel companies can\u0027t acknowledge climate change and their role in it, but then act as if it won\u0027t affect them and their investors,\" said Thomas DiNapoli, New York\u0027s comptroller.

      "articleBody": "April 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve may allow big banks to use some municipal bonds to meet new liquidity rules that ensure they have enough cash during a credit crunch, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The Fed had excluded debt issued by cities and states when it approved liquidity rules for large banks in September, part of a global effort to make banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup more resilient in a financial crisis. Fed officials had at that time said they did not think the rule would have significant implications for the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. The Fed had also said it planned to propose allowing certain high-liquid municipal securities to count as a sellable asset at a later date, after further review. U.S. cities and states have been urging the Fed, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to classify muni bonds as highly liquid if they are investment grade and have demonstrated reliable liquidity during times of economic stress. However, the plan under discussion falls short of including all investment-grade municipal bonds, the Journal said. The exact criteria for the kind of municipal bonds that would count under the rule has not been set, but a key focus will be the ability of a bank to sell the bonds in a fairly short time frame, the newspaper said. The other regulators - the OCC and the FDIC, do not plan to follow the Fed, the newspaper said. (on.wsj.com/1yy2WIt) Reuters could not immediately reach the regulators for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. The U.S. municipal bond market grew to $3.652 trillion during the fourth quarter, with banks picking up $41.1 billion, up from the prior quarter\u0027s $34.5 billion, according to data released by the Fed in March.

      "articleBody": "BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - Two years ago, just one Chinese SUV ranked among the country\u0027s top-10. In the first three months of this year, that number jumped to eight - a sign that Chinese automakers may have found their sweet-spot to battle foreign rivals in the world\u0027s biggest car market. Despite preferential government policies, local carmakers have failed to really compete with foreign automakers like Volkswagen AG and General Motors in sedan sales. Shifting the battleground to the roomier sport utility vehicle segment may bring more success. \"The domestic SUV market has entered a period of enduring, rapid growth, the market scope has expanded and more indigenous brands have gained momentum,\" a spokeswoman for Shenzhen-based BYD said in an emailed statement. \"Moreover, BYD, Great Wall, Geely and other indigenous brands have made enormous progress in technology, quality and service.\" Retail sales of SUVs jumped by more than a third last year to 3.82 million as Chinese drivers, who are growing wealthier and are often restricted to a single car purchase in crowded cities, increasingly opt for larger vehicles. IHS Automotive predicts SUV sales will increase by more than a fifth this year, before 2016 growth slips into single digits. Chongqing Changan Automobile and Great Wall Motor will launch fresh versions of their top-selling SUVs at this week\u0027s Shanghai autoshow, while others such as BYD are expected to unveil new models in a rush to ride the rising popularity of SUVs. SUV FOCUS Chinese automakers have been helped by having the right products for the SUV market at the right price and well in advance of foreign rivals - just as SUV sales took off. It\u0027s the result of years of focusing resources on developing \"good enough\" quality SUVs with attractive exteriors. \"Because local carmakers can\u0027t really compete on sedans, they\u0027ve really focused in recent years on launching more SUVs,\" said Yale Zhang, managing director of Automotive Foresight in Shanghai. Great Wall, for example, launched three new SUVs last year, helping its SUV business grow by a quarter, while its sedan sales dropped 57 percent as it pared back production. Overall in 2014, Chinese brands launched 18 SUV models, while foreign competitors launched 11, Automotive Foresight data show. New entrants to China\u0027s top-10 SUVs are built on sedan frames and are priced cheaply enough to appeal to first-time buyers in a slowing economy. Great Wall\u0027s Haval H2 starts at 99,800 yuan ($16,087) and Changan\u0027s CS75 at 108,800 yuan. Honda Motor\u0027s CR-V, largely comparable to a Haval H6, starts at 193,800 yuan. Global brands have dominated car production since China\u0027s economic opening despite strict limitations that require foreign automakers to form 50:50 joint ventures with local partners in order to manufacture in China. Some Chinese automakers have achieved a large enough scale with indigenous SUV brands and are seen as reliable by domestic drivers, though that\u0027s not enough to command loyalty or premium pricing, said Tom Doctoroff, Asia-Pacific CEO for ad firm JWT. Consequently, Doctoroff says, those brands are a long way from breaking into mature global markets like Europe or the United States, where leading Chinese SUV brands - which also include those from BAIC Motor (IPO-BAC.SS), Chery, JAC Motors and Zotye - remain virtual unknowns.

      "articleBody": "TORONTO, April 16 (Reuters) - Top executives at Canada\u0027s largest banks, insurers and pension funds sounded a bullish over investing in India after meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is making the first bilateral visit to Canada by an Indian premier for 42 years. Modi held a roundtable with the heads of major Canadian financial institutions in Toronto on Thursday, stressing that his government is focused on reducing bureaucracy and investment hurdles, and adding it would welcome investments in infrastructure projects. He also said that he understood the need for consistency in regulation and that India has learnt from its past missteps. The message resonated with Canadian business heads, some of whose firms have already lined up, or raised funds to invest in India following Modi\u0027s election victory last year. \"It\u0027s great to see a leader who\u0027s focused on reducing red tape, reducing roadblocks, and encouraging development.\" said Dean Connor, chief executive of insurer Sun Life Financial Inc that has had a presence in India for over 15 years. \"I don\u0027t think anybody thinks it will be easy, but he is an impressive leader and he\u0027s got an impressive track record,\" said Connor, noting that Modi clearly expressed that his government would not pursue retrospective application of tax rules, which has been a problematic issue for investors in the past. Canadian pension funds and insurers have been pouring money into infrastructure, real estate, logistics and other assets overseas in the last few years, as they chase long-term returns. Last year, Canada\u0027s largest pension fund manager the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) said it would invest $332 million in infrastructure projects in India via a tie-up with engineering and construction firm Larsen \u0026 Toubro. Thats move came shortly after CPPIB had outlined investments in Indian real estate. \"We see great growth potential in India, and are encouraged by the significant reforms Prime Minister Modi has achieved less than one year after taking office,\" said Scotiabank CEO Brian Porter. Others like Fairfax Financial run by noted value investor Prem Watsa are equally bullish. Watsa, who met with Modi briefly on Wednesday, earlier this year raised $1 billion via an IPO, with the funds exclusively earmarked for investments in India. \"The opportunities are huge and the $1 billion, we think is just the first billion we will be investing there,\" said Watsa, while speaking at Fairfax\u0027s shareholder meeting on Thursday.

Citi has been slowly getting its house in order by cutting costs and shedding assets that are not critical to its main businesses. It has sold retail operations in many countries and shrunk its U.S. branch network. Shares of the third biggest U.S. bank by assets rose 2.3 percent to $54.45 on Thursday. Citi\u0027s operating expenses fell 10 percent to $10.88 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 as it spent less on employee compensation and advertising and marketing. The bank reached its target of having operating expenses of about 55 percent of revenue, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a call. Legal and restructuring costs fell to $403 million from $1.16 billion. Revenue from investment banking, which is part of Citi\u0027s institutional clients group, rose 14 percent to about $1.20 billion. However, overall revenue in the institutional clients group fell 1 percent to $9.03 billion, hurt by lower fixed income trading revenue. Gerspach said that without losses from Swiss currency trading, Citigroup\u0027s rates and currencies revenue would have been up by more than 20 percent from a year earlier. He, however, declined to give a dollar figure. Revenue in Citi\u0027s global consumer banking business fell 2 percent to $8.66 billion. The bank has exited or is exiting consumer businesses in countries including Japan, Turkey, Czech Republic and Hungary. Corbat aims to use Citi\u0027s streamlined structure to return more capital to shareholders. He made progress toward that goal in March when the Federal Reserve approved his plans to raise dividends and buy back shares. Citi\u0027s return on assets was 1.05 percent, higher than Corbat\u0027s target of at least 0.9 percent for the year. The bank\u0027s tier-1 common equity capital ratio rose to 11 percent from 10.6 percent in the fourth quarter as it used $1.2 billion of deferred tax assets, in line with its expectation of utilizing about $4 billion annually. Adjusted net income rose 16 percent to $4.82 billion, or $1.52 per share, beating average analyst estimate of $1.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusted revenue fell 2 percent to $19.81 billion. Fixed income trading revenue declined 11 percent to $3.48 billion. In contrast, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co reported higher revenue from fixed income trading. (Editing by Kirti Pandey)",

The employee of Menzies Aviation, an airport ground services company, made news on Monday as an unintended stowaway on Alaska Flight 448 when he woke up from a nap inside the sealed baggage compartment to realize the plane was already airborne. The pilot of the Los Angeles-bound flight, with 170 people aboard, turned the jet around to make a safe but unscheduled emergency landing back at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport after the crew heard banging beneath the aircraft. Emerging unhurt from the plane, the wayward baggage handler told authorities he had dozed off inside the forward cargo hold before takeoff. He later passed a drug test and was released from a hospital where he was taken for evaluation, the airline said. The worker, who has not been publicly identified, was never in danger because the cargo compartment was pressurized and temperature-controlled, airline officials said. But in a panicky 911-emergency call placed after awaking inside the belly of the plane, the worker pleaded with the operator for help, screaming, \"I can\u0027t breathe,\" before the connection was lost, according to a recording released by airport authorities on Thursday. Also on Thursday, a spokesman for Menzies Aviation, a subsidiary of British-based John Menzies, said the worker had been placed on administrative duties pending an investigation. However, Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan told Reuters: \"The employee has been permanently banned from ever working again on an Alaska Airlines operation.\" She did not elaborate but said workers were not permitted to sleep on the job. She said coworkers had noticed he was missing before the jet took off and tried calling and texting his cell phone without success, then \"figured he had left his shift.\" The Menzies spokesman, Mickey Mandelbaum, said the employee in question was in his early 20s and had worked for the company for 18 months. All such terminal ramp workers carry security badges, undergo full criminal background checks and drug screening before being hired, and are subject to random drug tests throughout their employment, according to Alaska Airlines. A spokesman for the Seattle Port Authority said law enforcement agencies were not investigating the incident because there was no security breach or criminal violation.

      "articleBody": "NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is rolling out a new pay TV plan that allows consumers to choose every month bundles of channels they want to see, hoping the flexibility will lure customers away from cable rivals and upstart Web TV companies. The move is a small step in the direction of \u0027a la carte\u0027 programming, which means allowing customers to build their own pay TV service, channel by channel. U.S. television networks have long resisted \u0027a la carte,\u0027 in part because of concerns that subscribers will drop less popular channels. Verizon said its new \"Custom TV\" packages start at $65 a month for broadband service, 36 fixed basic channels and two genre-based channel packs, such as a sports bundle or kids channels. Users can add extra packs for $10 each, or swap or unsubscribe any pack after 30 days. Verizon has seven channel packs in total. Verizon is targeting consumers looking for something in between fully loaded cable and satellite TV packages, and \"skinny\" or smaller, cheaper bundles offered Comcast Corp or Dish Network Corp\u0027s online Sling TV. \"Everybody is getting into the video space... increasingly customers are saying, \u0027I want to pay for what I view,\u0027\" Tami Erwin, the president of Verizon\u0027s national operations told Reuters. Verizon\u0027s FiOS is the sixth-largest U.S. pay TV provider by video subscribers, according to research form IDC. The rise of online video services such as Netflix Inc has put pressure on pay TV providers to innovate. Analysts said Custom TV could help Verizon better compete against cable rivals. \"It\u0027s not a pure \u0027a la carte\u0027 the way some consumers want, but we are certainly through the Verizon offering going to have more choice and the type of choice that has not been associated with traditional pay TV services,\" Greg Ireland, a director at market research firm IDC said. Dish\u0027s Sling TV offers a fixed set of basic channels at $20 a month, and genre-specific bundles can be added for $5. The service runs on an Internet connection that a user needs to pay for separately. Chris Young, an analyst at research firm SNL Kagan, said Verizon is trying to give customers more customization and the greater amount of flexibility \"could prevent some customers from cutting the cord.\" (Reporting by Malathi Nayak; Editing by Tiffany Wu)",

      "articleBody": "* Spreadbetters see mixed openings for European bourses * Lacklustre U.S. data lessens chances of June rate hike * Nikkei wallows below 20,000 level hit last week * Oil futures skid on OPEC supply after touching 2015 highs By Lisa Twaronite TOKYO, April 17 (Reuters) - An index of Asian shares edged away from fresh seven-year highs on Friday but was still on track to score weekly gains, while the dollar languished after lacklustre U.S. economic data made a near-term interest rate hike appear less likely. Financial spreadbetters expected Britain\u0027s FTSE 100 to open up by 12 to 15 points, or 0.2 percent higher. Germany\u0027s DAX was seen opening down by 16 to 19 points, or 0.2 percent lower, and France\u0027s CAC 40 was seen opening unchanged to down by 4 points, or flat in percentage terms. Europe\u0027s stock markets have lately pushed to multi-year peaks, with both the FTSE and DAX setting record highs this year as new economic stimulus measures from the European Central Bank offset worries about Greece\u0027s fiscal woes. \"For Europe this morning, traders will have to decide what has more weight: declining economic fundamentals or the prospect of dovish central banks,\" Jonathan Sudaria, a dealer at Capital Spreads, said in a note. MSCI\u0027s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped slightly after earlier touching its highest level since January 2008, but was still on track for a weekly gain of over 1 percent. Hong Kong\u0027s Hang Seng index rose 0.4 percent, approaching this week\u0027s seven-year highs triggered by inflows from mainland investors. The Shanghai Composite Index surged 2.6 percent, on track to end up more than 6 percent for the week. But Japan\u0027s Nikkei stock average slipped 1.2 percent, marking a weekly loss around 1.3 percent. After breaking the 20,000 level for the first time in 15 years a week ago, the Nikkei has wobbled below it, with investors wary of Japanese corporate earnings reports slated for release from next week. \"Even though investors expect companies to post big profits at the end of the financial year, the Nikkei\u0027s moves may be contained in a small range after companies\u0027 modest guidance,\" said Masayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities. UNINSPIRING U.S. DATA Wall Street ended with modest losses on Thursday amid worries about upcoming corporate earnings, and after another spate of uninspiring economic data. U.S. housing starts rose far less than expected in March and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region grew modestly this month, suggesting the economic momentum will probably not be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to decide to start raising interest rates as early as June. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart, a voting member of the Fed\u0027s rate-setting committee this year, said the recent \"murky\" run of U.S. data has him leaning against a June interest rate hike. Lockhart quickly added he was confident the economy will remain on track. Comments from Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren also struck dovish tones. Fading expectations for a June rate hike pressured the U.S. dollar. The dollar index, which measures the greenback\u0027s performance against a basket of major currencies, last traded at 97.651 . It had set a one-week low of 97.282 on Thursday and is down 1.7 percent so far this week. \"It has been a run of weak data in recent weeks, and that\u0027s clearly undermining the dollar at present,\" said Mitul Kotecha, head of FX strategy, Asia-Pacific for Barclays in Singapore. The U.S. unit bought 118.98 yen, down slightly on the day and well off this week\u0027s high of 120.845. The euro bought $1.0765, up slightly on the day after climbing as high as $1.0818 on Thursday despite rising concerns about Greece. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told Reuters on Thursday he was \"firmly optimistic\" his government would reach an agreement with its creditors by the end of April despite friction over issues such as pension and labour reform. The country\u0027s Finance Ministry denied a report by the Financial Times that Athens had approached the International Monetary Fund to request a delay in its loan repayments. Crude oil prices tumbled in Asian trading, giving back the sharp gains made overnight on news that a tribal group made up of former Al Qaeda militants took control of a major southern oil terminal in Yemen. Brent crude shed 0.6 percent to $63.57 a barrel while U.S. crude gave up 0.7 percent to $56.29, after both hit 2015 peaks in the previous session, following news Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said its March production surged, adding to a global supply glut. In other commodities trading, London tin plunged 6.7 percent to more than five-year lows, on growing supply and slack demand.

      "articleBody": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., April 16 (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force plans to ask satellite launch providers and engine makers next month or in early June to explain how they would partner up to develop a new launch vehicle powered by a U.S.-built engine, a top Air Force general said on Thursday. General John Hyten, who heads Air Force Space Command, told Reuters the Air Force was finalizing its strategy for spending $220 million in funds set aside by Congress in the fiscal 2015 budget, and would issue a request for proposals soon. Hyten said Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center aimed to publish the document by the end of May, but that might slip to early June since there was \"a lot of work left to do.\" The Air Force is racing to end reliance on the Russian-built RD-180 engine that powers the first stage of the Atlas 5 rocket built by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture run by Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Congress last year passed a law banning use of the Russian engines for national security launches after 2019, given Russia\u0027s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. ULA launches most U.S. military and intelligence satellites at the moment, but the Air Force is on track to certify privately held Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, to compete to launch some of those satellites by June, or possibly a bit sooner, Air Force Secretary Deborah James told reporters. She said she was concerned about the 2019 deadline, since ULA\u0027s new U.S.-powered Vulcan rocket would not be ready until later. Unless Congress changed the law, the Air Force\u0027s only launch option for some years might be SpaceX, which would undermine the goal of a competitive launch market, she said. ULA says the new rocket should fly in 2019, but might not be certified for Air Force use until 2022 or 2023. It plans to use the BE-4 engine being developed by Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, using its own money, but is also working with GenCorp Inc\u0027s Aerojet Rocketdyne unit, which is developing the AR-1 engine. Hyten said he fully expected a response to the request that included Aerojet Rocketdyne, which has also been working with private research group Dynetics Inc to reduce the risk of developing a new engine. Orbital ATK has also said it would be interested in a U.S.-built engine, if one were available. (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

      "articleBody": "By Krista Hughes WASHINGTON, April 16 (Reuters) - Senior U.S. lawmakers reached agreement on Thursday on a bill to give the White House \"fast track\" authority to negotiate a trade pact with 11 other Pacific nations that is central to President Barack Obama\u0027s strategic shift toward Asia. The agreement, over six months in the making, sets the stage for a tough legislative battle over the rules for Obama\u0027s proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The pact would connect a dozen economies by cutting trade barriers and harmonizing standards covering two-fifths of the world economy and a third of global trade. The bill gives lawmakers the right to set negotiating objectives, but would restrict them to a yes-or-no vote on trade deals such as the TPP, a potential legacy-defining achievement for President Obama. The Obama administration announced in late 2009 that it was entering TPP negotiations with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The U.S. Trade Representative calls the negotiation the \"cornerstone\" of Obama\u0027s Asia-Pacific economic policy. It also is important to U.S. manufacturers and farmers eager to expand already significant sales to the region by winning lower tariffs and other breaks. U.S. labor unions that are active supporters of Democratic politicians fear the deal will favor big U.S. corporations at the expense of American jobs and tougher foreign safety and environmental standards. While trade associations and companies such as Intel Corp , Emerson Electric Co and Microsoft Corp welcomed the move, unions immediately announced a new advertising campaign to pressure lawmakers. Similar arguments raged in the run-up to the 1993 congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Twenty-two years later there is still a debate over that deal, which badly split the Democratic Party and was passed in the House of Representatives by a narrow 234-200 vote. The bill also faces opposition from some conservative Republicans opposed to delegating power to the White House. The Obama administration has faced pressure to make progress on the TPA bill ahead of a meeting between Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on April 28 in Washington. Japanese and U.S. officials met this week in Tokyo in a bid to strike a two-way deal giving momentum to the pact. Japanese officials have said success depends on whether the U.S. Congress approves fast-track measures to ease passage of trade deals, or trade promotion authority (TPA). Japan and other TPP countries have said fast-track authority would give trading partners certainty that agreements will not be picked apart. \"This is a smart, bipartisan compromise that will help move America forward,\" Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch said after leaders of Congress\u0027s tax-writing committees reached agreement on the legislation, which will be introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives. DIFFICULTIES AHEAD TPP must pass Congress this year to avoid being bogged down in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. elections where it could put Hillary Clinton, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president, in a difficult spot. As a former member of the Obama administration, she needs to walk a tightrope between supporting her former boss and warning of the need for tougher trade deals. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, oversaw passage of the NAFTA deal that many unions loathe. The deal between Hatch and the panel\u0027s top Democrat, Ron Wyden, to move Trade Promotion Authority ahead in tandem with a bill to extend support for workers hurt by trade is no guarantee the legislation will pass Congress. Opponents are lobbying hard to defeat it and many Democrats are still undecided. \"You bring up TPA in the House today, the best you would have is a handful of Democrats,\" Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives committee responsible for trade, said at a Bloomberg conference. Still, 11 members of the New Democrat Coalition, seen as the most likely source of potential Democratic support, said the package included several of their priorities and they would work with colleagues to make the bill as strong as possible. Chuck Schumer, tipped to become the Senate\u0027s Democratic leader after the 2016 elections, told a committee hearing he opposes TPA. He and other Senate Finance Committee Democrats said it is not fair to rush such an important issue. \"You can\u0027t fast track fast track - that\u0027s a complete abdication of our responsibilities,\" said Ohio Democrat Sherrod Brown.

      "articleBody": "* Canadian miner awarded $750 mln in arbitration decision * Dispute centers on Las Brisas gold concession * Major court decisions expected this year-Gold Reserve By Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, April 16 (Reuters)- - Gold Reserve Inc, a small Canadian miner that lost its crown jewel in a 2009 expropriation, is targeting Venezuelan assets as it seeks to collect a $750 million arbitration award that would put new strains on the cash-strapped government\u0027s finances. With higher-profile cases including Exxon and ConocoPhillips mired in delays, a technicality in Gold Reserve\u0027s case filing has allowed it to aggressively seek out new jurisdictions to execute its award. Its actions could affect bondholders. Gold Reserve said on Monday it has served various Luxembourg banks with writs of garnishment relating to around $700 million in interest payments on Venezuelan bonds and funds. The company targeted banks seen as paying or transfer agents. The dispute puts more pressure on President Nicolas Maduro amid mounting worries about Venezuela\u0027s ability to service debt and stave off a potential technical default due to unpaid arbitration awards. \"We are definitely looking at other jurisdictions,\" Gold Reserve\u0027s president, Doug Belanger, told Reuters on Thursday. \"Anything that\u0027s a commercial asset of the Venezuelan government is on the table.\" He said Gold Reserve is eyeing countries with the \"best jurisdiction, best law and most assets.\" He declined to give further details. The company is also engaged in legal wrangling in France, Luxembourg and the United States, with decisions expected this year, Belanger said. Officials at Venezuela\u0027s petroleum and mining ministry were not immediately available to comment. ASSETS EYED As a major crude producer and exporter, socialist-run Venezuela has considerable international assets. And with 96 percent of its income stemming from oil revenue amid a deep recession, the stakes are high. The country owns major U.S refining unit Citgo Petroleum Corp and has stakes in the Chalmette refinery in Louisiana, as well as a network of refineries in the Caribbean, Sweden and the United Kingdom. But Venezuela has also moved to sell some of these units, raising questions whether Caracas wants to reduce exposure to avoid potential asset grabs, although the government has said it would pay negative awards. Legal adversaries have blasted Venezuela\u0027s moves to recuse arbitrators or request revisions and annulments to awards as tactics designed to stave off paying. Gold Reserve took its case to an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) tribunal, which in September determined Venezuela must pay for the termination. The award is enforceable in any of the 150-plus member states party to the New York Convention. In parallel, Gold Reserve continues to talk with government representatives, Belanger said. \"There have been fruitful discussions recently,\" he said, declining to comment on whether any settlement offers were on the table. \"Venezuela has an opportunity to settle this.\" Venezuela in 2009 nationalized Gold Reserve\u0027s Las Brisas concession, one of Latin America\u0027s largest gold deposits, as part of a policy to increase state control of key economic sectors. Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Strategy at Jefferies, said it\u0027s unclear how much cash Venezuela has on hand to pay the award, which bears interest of Libor plus 2 percent. \"My initial thinking was that Venezuela will use delay tactics as long as possible but if there\u0027s a risk of a technical default they\u0027ll pay Gold Reserve,\" she said.
